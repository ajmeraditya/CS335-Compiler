Update on language features
1. We will allow implicit typecasting for the following cases.

integer <-> bool

integer <-> float

Bool to float not allowed

2. The following situation should be an error.

i : float = 3.14

def or use of mylist[i]   <----- error

3. We will use two forms of the range() function: range(start, stop) and range(stop). It is okay if you want to handle these specially in your implementation.

4. A function in the global scope and a class method can have the same name.  

5. Objects will always be created with explicit constructor calls and a l-value on the LHS. You can assume that the test cases will respect this constraint.

a : myclass = myclass(1,2)  <---- valid

myclass(1,2) <--- invalid

/////////// should this work? 
1. public1.py
add bool
2. public2.py
min_value: float = None -> DONE it is not allowed
//////////



//if statement false condition
None
0
empty
""
NULL


//////
1. Dynamic resizing isn't allowed
2. Treat strings as immutable
//////


// can variable name be t+number coz they are regsiter names in 3ac
