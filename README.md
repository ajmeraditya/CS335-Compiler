# Project Documentation
This is a course project for CS335:Compiler Design taken by Prof. Swarnendu Biswas

The goal of this project is to implement a compilation toolchain, where the input is in Python language and the output is x86_64 code

**Milestone1** 

[Milestone1.pdf](doc/Milestone1.pdf)

We implement a scanner i.e. lexer and parser for the given python input which generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

**Milestone2**

[Milestone2.pdf](doc/Milestone2.pdf)

From the AST we generate the 3 Address Code (3AC)

**Milestone3**

[Milestone3.pdf](doc/Milestone3.pdf)

From the generated 3AC code we create the x86 Assembly Code which can be run using GNU Assmebler

The sample outputs are present in output folder
